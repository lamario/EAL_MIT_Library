Dear Student,

It seems there is an item from the School Library that you have not returned on time. The due-back time was set to: one month. The item in question is: 

In other case, maybe you just didnâ€™t let us know about the return.

I would like to kindly ask you to respond to this email with the reasoning for not returning this item and the whereabouts of it. 

To return an item to the Library, please place it on one of the shelves in the Repository room (room no. B2-03D). To open the room, please ask either one of the teachers or the Library Assistant. 

Kind regards,

Richard.
