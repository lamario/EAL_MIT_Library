Borrowing rules & regulations:

Dear Colleague / Student
Items in the server-room (this room) & the repository-room should be stored organized. We won’t be able to find things, if you didn’t put them back in the right place. 
To borrow at item, find a teacher or the Library Assistant to open the room for you, but I don’t recommend disturbing the teachers for this. You can usually find me - Richard, the Library Guy - in the 1.st semester IT-Technology classroom.

Borrowing rules & regulations:
•	Send an email to mitlibrary@eal.dk containing the following info to borrow an item: 
o	Your name
o	Your eal.dk or edu.eal.dk email address
o	Name & bar-code no. of borrowed item
o	No. of days to borrow

•	Borrowing an item for less than a day does not need registration. Just kindly put the borrowed item back in the right place. 

•	To return an item which is registered as borrowed, move it to the repository room (room no. B2-03D). There are three shelves (first rack on the left) in the repository room that you can leave borrowed items on. Items on those shelves will be registered by the Library Assistant.
