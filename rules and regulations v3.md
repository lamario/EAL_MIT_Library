Borrowing rules & regulations:

Dear Colleague / Student
Items in the server-room (this room) and the repository-room should be stored organized. We won’t be able to find things, if you don’t put them back in the right place. 
To borrow an item, find a teacher or the Library Assistant to open the room for you. You can usually find me - Richard, the Library Guy - in the 1.st semester IT-Technology classroom (room no. ).

Borrowing rules & regulations:
•	Send an email to mitlibrary@eal.dk containing the following info to borrow an item: 
    o	Your name
    o	Your eal.dk or edu.eal.dk email address
    o	Name & bar-code no. of borrowed item
    o	No. of days to borrow

•	To return an item which is registered as borrowed, move it to the repository room (room no. B2-03D). There are three shelves (first rack on the left) in the repository room that you can leave borrowed items on. Items on those shelves will be registered by the Library Assistant.

•	When returning an item please send an email to mitlibrary@eal.dk stating: Returning this item: [and the barcode of the returned item]
 
•	Borrowing an item for less than a day does not need registration. Just place the borrowed item on the shelf in the repository room


Regards
